# Release Version Info
# Semantic versioning looks like: xx.yy.zz where:
# - xx = major (8-bits)
# - yy = minor (8-bits)
# - zz = patch (16-bits)
#
# File content and layout is such that the YAML can be parsed by build-time tools
# as well as the CI/build pipeline YAML files. The root 'variables' element is there
# for DevOps.
#

variables:
  version.major: 2021
  version.minor: 02
