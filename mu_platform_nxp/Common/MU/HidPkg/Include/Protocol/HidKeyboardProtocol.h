  HidKeyboardProtocol.h

Abstract:

  This header defines an interface for transmitting HID data between hardware and Keyboard HID processing driver.

Environment:

  UEFI pre-boot Driver Execution Environment (DXE).

Spec:
  Refer to USB Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID) version 1.11 Appendix B.1
